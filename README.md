## Overview
This Power BI project delivers a comprehensive analysis of mobile sales performance through an interactive dashboard. It transforms raw sales data into clear visual insights on revenue trends, product performance, and customer behavior across different regions. The dashboard enables data-driven decision making for sales strategy, inventory planning, and market expansion by providing key metrics on demand patterns, payment preferences, and geographical performance.

## Objectives

- Analyze total sales revenue and units sold across all markets
- Evaluate performance by brand, specific mobile models, and geographic locations
- Identify customer payment method preferences and satisfaction levels
- Uncover monthly and daily sales trends for strategic planning
- Provide actionable insights for inventory management and growth strategy

## Findings and Conclusion

- Patient Volume: The ER handled a total of 513 patients during the analyzed period.
- Admission Rate: A slight majority of patients (52.4%) were admitted for further treatment, while 47.6% were treated and discharged from the ER.
- Operational Timeliness: Only 38.4% of patients were seen within the target wait time of 30 minutes, indicating a significant area for improvement in patient flow.
- Patient Satisfaction: The average patient satisfaction score was 4.96, suggesting room for enhancement in the patient experience.
- Demographics: The patient age group was fairly distributed, with the highest number of patients (72) belonging to the 0-9 years bracket. The gender distribution    was nearly equal.
- Referral Trends: The majority of patients (299) did not require a referral to a specialty department. Among those who did, General Practice was the most common   referral department (103 referrals), followed by Orthopedics (65).

This Hospital ER Dashboard identifies patient wait times as the key area for improvement, providing clear insights to enhance operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.
